✨ UrlView is an extensible plugin for the [Neovim](https://neovim.io) text editor which essentially:

1. Finds URLs from a variety of **search contexts** (e.g. from a buffer, file, [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) and [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) plugin URLs)
2. Displays these URLs in a **picker**, such as the built-in `vim.ui.select` or [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
3. Performs **actions** on selected URLs, such as navigating to the URL in your preferred browser, or copying the link to your clipboard.

🎯 Additional features and example use cases include:

- Easily visualise all the URLs in a buffer or file (e.g. links in your Markdown documents)
- Quickly accessing repo webpages for installed Neovim plugins (life-saver for config updates or browsing plugin documentation)
- Ability to register custom searchers (e.g. Jira ticket numbers), pickers and actions (please see [docs](doc/urlview.txt) or `:h urlview.search-custom`)
- Jumping to the previous or next URL in the active buffer

> Please note that currently, this plugin only detects URLs beginning with a `http(s)` or `www` prefix for buffer and file search, but there are plans to support a more general pattern (see [🗺️ Roadmap](https://github.com/axieax/urlview.nvim/issues/3)).

## ⚡ Requirements

- This plugin supports **Neovim v0.7** or later.
- Please find the appropriate _\*-compat_ Git tag if you need legacy support for previous Neovim versions, such as [v0.6-compat](https://github.com/axieax/urlview.nvim/tree/v0.6-compat) for nvim v0.6, although these versions will no longer receive any new updates or features.
- For Neovim versions prior to v0.6 or Vanilla [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) support, please check out [urlview.vim](https://github.com/strboul/urlview.vim) as an alternative plugin.

## 🚀 Usage

### Searching contexts

1. Use the command `:UrlView` to see all the URLs in the current buffer.

- For your convenience, feel free to setup a keybind for this using `vim.keymap.set`:

  ```lua
  vim.keymap.set("n", "\\u", "<Cmd>UrlView<CR>", { desc = "view buffer URLs" })
  vim.keymap.set("n", "\\U", "<Cmd>UrlView packer<CR>", { desc = "view plugin URLs" })
  ```

- You can also hit `:UrlView <tab>` to see additional contexts that you can search from
  - e.g. `:UrlView packer` to view links for installed [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) plugins

2. You can optionally select a link to bring it up in your browser.

### Buffer URL navigation

1. You can use `[u` and `]u` (default bindings) to jump to the previous and next URL in the buffer respectively.
2. This keymap can be altered under the `jump` config option.

## 📦 Installation

Free free to install this plugin manually or with your favourite plugin manager. As an example, using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):

```lua
use("axieax/urlview.nvim")
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

This plugin supports plug-n-play, meaning you can get it up and running without any additional setup.

However, you can customise the [default options](lua/urlview/config/default.lua) using the `setup` function:

```lua
require("urlview").setup({
  -- custom configuration options --
})
```

Please check out the [documentation](doc/urlview.txt) for configuration options and details.

## 🎨 Pickers

### ✔️ Native (vim.ui.select)

You can customise the appearance of `vim.ui.select` with plugins such as [dressing.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim) and [telescope-ui-select.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-ui-select.nvim). In the demo images above, I used [dressing.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim)'s Telescope option, which allows me to further filter and fuzzy search through my entries.

### 🔭 Telescope

- Optional picker option
- Additional requirements (only if you're using this picker): [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
- You can use Telescope as your `default_picker` using the `require("urlview").setup` function
- Alternatively, you can specify a picker dynamically with `:UrlView <ctx> picker=telescope`
