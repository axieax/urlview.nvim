# 🔎 urlview.nvim

UrlView is a [Neovim](https://neovim.io) plugin which displays links from a variety of contexts (e.g. from a buffer, [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) plugin URLs), using the built-in `vim.ui.select` or [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) as a picker. These entries can also be selected to be brought up in your browser.

> Please note that currently, this plugin only detects URLs beginning with a HTTP(s) or www prefix, but there are plans to support a more general pattern, see [Roadmap](https://github.com/axieax/urlview.nvim/issues/3).

## ⚡ Requirements

This plugin requires **Neovim 0.6+**. If necessary, please check out **Alternatives** for other similar plugins supporting versions prior to 0.6.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Use the command `:UrlView` to see all the URLs in the current buffer.

- For your convenience, feel free to set a keybind for this using `vim.api.nvim_set_keymap`
- You can also hit `:UrlView <tab>` to see additional contexts that you can search from
  - e.g. `:UrlView packer` to view links for installed [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) plugins

2. You can optionally select a link to bring it up in your browser.

## 📦 Installation

Free free to install this plugin manually or with your favourite Plugin Manager. As an example, using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):

```lua
use("axieax/urlview.nvim")
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

This plugin supports plug-n-play, meaning you can get it up and running without any additional setup.

However, you can customise the default behaviour using the `setup` function:

```lua
require("urlview").setup({
  -- Prompt title (`<context> <default_title>`, e.g. `Buffer Links:`)
  default_title = "Links:",
  -- Default picker to display links with
  -- Options: "default" (vim.ui.select) or "telescope"
  default_picker = "default",
  -- Set the default protocol for us to prefix URLs with if they don't start with http/https
  default_prefix = "https://",
  -- Command or method to open links with
  -- Options: "netrw", "auto" (default OS browser); or "firefox", "chromium" etc.
  navigate_method = "netrw",
  -- Logs user warnings
  debug = true,
  -- Custom search captures
  -- NOTE: captures follow Lua pattern matching (https://riptutorial.com/lua/example/20315/lua-pattern-matching)
  custom_searches = {
    -- KEY: search source name
    -- VALUE: custom search function or table (map with keys capture, format)
    jira = {
      capture = "AXIE%-%d+",
      format = "https://jira.axieax.com/browse/%s",
    },
  },
})

-- OPTIONAL: for Telescope picker support
require("telescope").load_extension("urlview")
```

## 🎨 Pickers

### ✔️ Default (vim.ui.select)

You can customise the appearance of `vim.ui.select` with plugins such as [dressing.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim). In the demo above, I used the [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) option, which further allows me to filter and fuzzy search through my entries.

### 🔭 Telescope

- Additional requirements: [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
- Make sure you have the following in your config:

```lua
require("telescope").load_extension("urlview")
```

- You can now use Telescope as your picker with `:Telescope urlview`!
