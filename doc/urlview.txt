INTRODUCTION                                                           *urlview*

✨ urlview.nvim is essentially a plugin which:

1. Finds URLs from a variety of |urlview.search| contexts
2. Displays these URLs in one of the |urlview.pickers|
3. Performs |urlview.actions| on selected URLs from the pickers


================================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                                   *urlview.config*

urlview.nvim supports plug-n-play, meaning the default config is automatically
set up. However, the default options can be configured using the
`require("urlview").setup` function, with the configuration options below.

                                                  *urlview.config-default_title*
{default_title}                                       string (default: "Links:")

Forms part of the prompt title for the picker (`<context> <default_title>`). For
example, for the buffer search context with a default_title of "Links:", the
picker title becomes "Buffer Links:". The capitalisation of the first letter
in the default_title determines the capitalisation of the search context in
the prompt title as well. For example, a default_title of "links" will result
in a prompt title of "buffer links".

                                                 *urlview.config-default_picker*
{default_picker}                                      string (default: "native")

Default picker for `:UrlView` commands. This should be any one of the pickers in
|urlview.pickers|.

                                                 *urlview.config-default_prefix*
{default_prefix}                                    string (default: "https://")

Default prefix for URLs missing a HTTP protocol (e.g. "www.google.com" becomes
"https://www.google.com"). Such a protocol is required for |urlview.actions|
to be able to navigate to URLs. Another suggested option is "http://",
although it is less secure than the default HTTPS protocol.

                                                 *urlview.config-default_action*
{default_action}                                       string (default: "netrw")

Default action to take upon selecting a URL from a picker. This should be any
one of the actions in |urlview.actions|.

                                                 *urlview.config-default_register*
{default_register}                                     string (default: "+")

Default register to use when yankying.

                                         *urlview.config-default_include_branch*
{default_include_branch}                                boolean (default: false)

Default option for whether plugin URLs should link to the branch used by your
package manager, for |urlview.search-lazy|, |urlview.search-packer| or
|urlview.search-vimplug|. When this option is enabled, navigated links will
open the plugin's repository to the specific branch specified to your plugin
manager.

                                                         *urlview.config-unique*
{unique}                                                 boolean (default: true)

Enable to ensure links shown in the picker are unique (i.e. no duplicates).

                                                         *urlview.config-sorted*
{sorted}                                                 boolean (default: true)

Enable to ensure links shown in the picker are sorted alphabetically.

                                                  *urlview.config-log_level_min*
{log_level_min}    `vim.log.levels` enum or int (default: `vim.log.levels.INFO`)

Minimum log level for output from this plugin. Lower logging levels will be
ignored. >lua

  vim.log.levels = {
    TRACE = 0,
    DEBUG = 1,
    INFO = 2,
    WARN = 3
    ERROR = 4,
    OFF = 5,  -- Neovim v0.8+
  }
<
The default value of `vim.log.levels.INFO` means that INFO, WARN and ERROR
logs will all be displayed. Similarly, a log_level_min value of
`vim.log.levels.WARN` means that only WARN and ERROR logs will be displayed.
It is recommended for this value to be at least `vim.log.levels.WARN` to
ensure warnings are appropriately logged. Setting this value to
`vim.log.levels.OFF` (requires Neovim 0.8+) or `5` will effectively suppress
all logs.

                                                           *urlview.config-jump*
{jump}                                                               table (map)

Registers keymaps for jumps to the previous or next URL in the buffer.

Fields:

    {prev}                                                string (default: "[u")
    Mapping to jump to the previous URL in the buffer. Set to "" to disable.

    {next}                                                string (default: "]u")
    Mapping to jump to the previous URL in the buffer. Set to "" to disable.


================================================================================
USAGE                                                            *urlview.usage*

For normal usage, interaction with this plugin is mostly achieved through the
`:UrlView` command. This command provides completion to assist with specifying
appropriate search contexts and respective options.

Calling `:UrlView` without any additional arguments is the same as calling
`:UrlView buffer`, which finds URLs in the current buffer with the default
options configured ( |default_title|, |default_picker|, |default_action|,
|unique|, |sorted|, etc. ).

The command expects arguments in the format `:UrlView <ctx> <options...>`,
e.g. >lua

  :UrlView buffer bufnr=1
  :UrlView file filepath=/etc/hosts picker=telescope
  :UrlView packer sorted=false
<

================================================================================
SEARCH                                                          *urlview.search*

`urlview.search` provides functions which finds and extracts URLs from a
particular search context. The default search contexts can be found by the
exposed functions in the `urlview.search` module (or `urlview/search/init.lua`).

Buffer Search Context                                    *urlview.search-buffer*

The buffer search context finds URLs in a specific buffer (current by
default). To search a particular buffer, provide the desired buffer number
with `:UrlView buffer bufnr=<bufnr>`.

File Search Context                                        *urlview.search-file*

The file search context allows a user to find URLs in a particular file. This
requires passing in the parameter `filepath` for URLs in the desired file to be
searched, for example with `:UrlView file filepath="/etc/hosts"`.

Lazy Search Context                                       *urlview.search-lazy*

This search context resolves Git repository URLs for plugins installed with
the lazy.nvim plugin manager. Invoked with `:UrlView lazy`.

Packer Search Context                                    *urlview.search-packer*

This search context resolves Git repository URLs for plugins installed with
the packer.nvim plugin manager. Invoked with `:UrlView packer`.

vim-plug Search Context                                 *urlview.search-vimplug*

This search context resolves Git repository URLs for plugins installed with
the vim-plug plugin manager. Invoked with `:UrlView vimplug`.

Registering a custom search context                      *urlview.search-custom*

Custom search contexts can be registered for searching with `:UrlView <ctx>`.
The `generate_custom_search` function from the `urlview.search.helpers` module
can be used to quickly generate a function for capturing a Lua pattern and
optionally formatting it with `string.format`. The following resource is very
helpful for understanding basic Lua patterns:

- https://riptutorial.com/lua/example/20315/lua-pattern-matching

This function can then be assigned to the `urlview.search` module for use as a
search context to be selected with the `:UrlView` command (with completion).

Here is an example which finds Jira ticket numbers in the format of "AXIE-"
followed by any number (capture field). This entire pattern gets captured and
can then be embedded into the format string in the format field, allowing
a user to directly navigate to the Jira ticket in their browser. >lua

  local search = require("urlview.search")
  local search_helpers = require("urlview.search.helpers")
  search["jira"] = search_helpers.generate_custom_search({
    capture = "AXIE%-%d+",
    format = "https://jira.axieax.com/browse/%s",
  })

This allows for captures such as "AXIE-1", "AXIE-17", "AXIE-132". Feel free to
adjust the `capture` field to suit your needs.

A custom function can also be registered for a search context, as well as
additional parameters with something like >lua

  local search = require("urlview.search")
  search["fruits"] = function(opts)
    local fruits = { "apple", "banana", "watermelon" }
    if opts.include_tomato then
      table.insert(fruits, "tomato")
    end
    return fruits
  end

Additional parameters can be passed into the custom search context using the
`:UrlView` command, for example `:UrlView fruits include_tomato` or `:UrlView
fruits include_tomato=true`. Other types also work.

Please see `urlview/search/init.lua` for more examples. If you have a useful
custom search context, feel free to share it in
https://github.com/axieax/urlview.nvim/discussions/40 for others to use (and
potentially make it a built-in search context)!

PICKERS                                                        *urlview.pickers*

`urlview.pickers` are used to display the results from |urlview.search|.

vim.ui.select                                           *urlview.pickers-native*

This picker uses the built-in function `vim.ui.select` to display results. It
is recommended to use a UI-extension for `vim.ui.select` for enhanced
functionality (similar to |urlview.pickers-telescope|), including customising
popup locations and behaviour, and searching (even fuzzy-searching) through
results. An example of such a plugin is dressing.nvim
(https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim).

telescope                                            *urlview.pickers-telescope*

This picker uses the Telescope plugin
(https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) as a picker to display
results. Please note that this requires installing Telescope as a plugin in
order for it to be used as a picker.

Registering a custom picker                             *urlview.pickers-custom*

A recommendation for registering a custom picker is to first check out a
`vim.ui.select` UI-extension such as dressing.nvim
(https://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim) to see if your desired picker can
be used for the native picker (e.g. nui, fzf).

In the case that you want to write your own picker, you can register it by
adding it as a function to the `urlview.pickers` module. >lua

  local pickers = require("urlview.pickers")
  pickers["fzf"] = function(items, opts)
    -- TODO
  end
<
Please check out `urlview/pickers.lua` for examples on how to do this.


================================================================================
ACTIONS                                                        *urlview.actions*

`urlview.actions` determine the behaviour when a URL is selected with one of
the |urlview.pickers|.

netrw                                                    *urlview.actions-netrw*

The `netrw` action uses the built-in netrw feature to open a given URL in your
browser. However, some users may have this feature disabled, either explicitly
or due to "netrw hijack" behaviour from file-explorer Neovim plugins. Due to
this, if urlview detects that netrw is disabled, it will use
|urlview.actions-system| as a fallback by default.

system                                                  *urlview.actions-system*

This action opens URL in your system's default browser depending on your
operating system. If your system is not supported, please raise a GitHub issue
to have it included as a built-in options. Otherwise, specify a custom action
( |urlview.actions-custom|) for your use case.

clipboard                                            *urlview.actions-clipboard*

This action copies selected URLs to the system clipboard (specifically to
Neovim's {+} register).

Registering a custom action                             *urlview.actions-custom*

There are two main types of custom actions:

1. Execute a shell command which takes in your URL as an argument

This is the main use case for custom actions - specifying a browser such as
`chromium` or `firefox` to open your URL with. By default, this executes the
provided shell command and passes in the URL as an argument, such as >bash

  $ chromium 'https://www.google.com'
<
which launches Google in the chromium browser. This can be any executable (be
sure to find the correct path to your desired application).

2. Lua function

With urlview.nvim's principle of extensibility in mind, you can also register a
custom action as a Lua function by adding it to the `urlview.actions` module,
like so: >lua

  local actions = require("urlview.actions")
  actions["spectate"] = function(raw_url)
    -- TODO
  end
<

Please refer to `urlview/actions.lua` for examples, and feel free to create a
GitHub issue or pull request to add your custom Lua function action as a
built-in action if you think others can use it as well!
